#### **Members**: (James) Colton Nicholas, Yafet Kubrom, Michael Rakestraw, and Brandon Vojtkofsky
This README is here to show you the steps to build and to run the program we have written for Major 1!

## Section Authors
**Power:** *(James)* Colton Nicholas\
**Palindrome:** Yafet Kubrom\
**Reverse:** Michael Rakestraw\
**Replace:** Brandon Vojtkofsky

## Building and Running with Makefile
**Compile:** `make`\
**Run:** `make run`\
**Clean Build Directory:** `make clean`

## Runtime
As noted above, run the program with `make run`.\
First, you will be prompted with a menu. Choose from power, replace, ... or exit.\
If any (valid) option other than exit is chosen, enter a number greater than 0 and less than 2 billion\
along with anything else that is prompted for.\
After this, you will again be prompted by the menu, free to repeat as many functions until you would\
like to exit.\
Hooray! You should have now successfully run the program ... \**cross your fingers*\* !
