# CSCE 3600 (Principles of Systems Programming, SP2020)

This course focus on systems programming, from standpoint of learning how computer software works and improving student's programming skills in K&R C and bash (Bourne-Again Shell). Covered topics were sed, gawk, bash, processes, threats, IPC (including sockets), compilers and python.  

## Programs

1. Major
  - Major 1 - Bitwise Operators
  - Major 2 - Create a shell
2. Minor
  - Minor 1 - sed&gawk
  - Minor 2 - bash
  - Minor 3 - command-line interpreter (Linux Kernel)
  - Minor 4 - sockets (tic-tac-toe)
  - Minor 5 - python  (tic-tac-toe)
3. Recitation
  - rec 1 - bitwise operator (convert ASCII character to decimal)
  - rec 2 - bitwise operator (swap two variables without using third variable)
  - rec 3 - sed&gawk (outputs)
  - rec 4 - bash (intro)
  - rec 5 - bash
  - rec 6 - processes (zombie and orphan)
  - rec 7 - thread
  - rec 8 - IPC (redirection and pipeline)
  - rec 9 - socket (internet stream over tcp)
  - rec 10- Compiler (compiler construction (flex))

## Notes
- Bash
- IPC
- Processes
